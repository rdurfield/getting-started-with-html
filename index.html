<header> <b> How the Web Works </b> </header> <p>

The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other. When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a <i>HTTP Request </i> to a <i> server </i>. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a <i>web browser </i> interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen. This video does a good job of explaining.<p>

<header> <b>HTML</b> </header><p>

HTML stands for <i>Hypertext Markup Language </i>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on the web. HTML documents contain <i>text content </i> which describes "what you see" and <i>markup </i>which describes "how it looks". <p>

<header><b>Tags and Elements</b></header><p>

HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements </b>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags </b>. <p>

<header><b>Why Computers are Stupid</b></header><p>

Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.
<header><b/>Inline vs Block Elements</b></header><p>

HTML elements are either <b> inline </b> or <b>block </b>. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.
